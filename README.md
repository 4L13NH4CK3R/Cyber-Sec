# Cyber-Sec 
What is Cyber-Sec? This is nothing more than 1 mans dream of starting his own programming & pen testing firm. This will be achieved  
by building random applications that the consumers will enjoy on both Residental & Commercial grades, and handling bug bounty  
programs, Crypto H4ck3r (AKA Aubrey Love), is aiming to build a small agency to bring the public new applications!  
  
## What Type of Programs?  
The initial goal is web-based applications, fun and interactive websites, mobile applications and even games!  
I intended to develop the following by the year 2025;  
1) Web-Based Application for Commercial Clients to help increase their business production!  
1) Web-Based Application for Residential Clients to help them connect with each other more securely!  
1) Android Application  
1) iOS Application
